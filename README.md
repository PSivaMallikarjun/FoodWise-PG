## ðŸš€ Getting Started & Deployment

To get this application running in real-time on the web, you can deploy it for free using Firebase.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2.  **Firebase Account**: Create a free account at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com/).
3.  **Firebase CLI**: Install the Firebase command-line tools globally:
    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```

### Deployment Steps

1.  **Create a Firebase Project**:
    - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Click "Add project" and follow the on-screen instructions.

2.  **Set Up Your Web App in Firebase**:
    - Inside your new project, go to **Project Overview** and click the Web icon (`</>`) to add a new web app.
    - Give it a nickname and register the app.
    - Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. **Copy these credentials.**

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    - In this project, create a new file named `.env.local`.
    - Paste the credentials you copied into this file, formatting them like so:
      ```
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project-id.firebaseapp.com
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project-id.appspot.com
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=12345...
      NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:12345...:web:...
      ```

4.  **Enable Firebase Services**:

    - **Authentication**: Click "Get started" and enable the **Email/Password** sign-in method.
    - **Firestore Database**: Click "Create database," start in **production mode**, and choose a location.

5.  **Log in to Firebase & Deploy**:
    - Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and log in:
      ```bash
      firebase login
      ```
    - Associate your local project with your Firebase project:
      ```bash
      firebase use --add
      ```
      Select the project you created from the list.
    - Deploy the application:
      ```bash
      npm run deploy
      ```

After deployment is complete, Firebase will give you a public URL (e.g., [`https://`](https://9000-firebase-studio-1752312375173.cluster-fdkw7vjj7bgguspe3fbbc25tra.cloudworkstations.dev/login)). You can now visit this URL to use your application live!
